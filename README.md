Health Monitoring Systems

[Here is an article that helps to understand the Adult Vital Signs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vital_signs)

[Here is a reference to Medical monitoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitoring_(medicine))

## Purpose

Continuous monitoring of vital signs, such as respiration and heartbeat, plays a crucial role in early detection and prediction of conditions that may affect the wellbeing of a patient. 

Monitoring requires accurate reading and thresholding of the vitals.

## Issues

- The code here has high complexity in a single function.
- The code is not modular 
- The tests are not complete - they do not cover all the needs of a consumer

## Tasks

1. Reduce the cyclomatic complexity.
1. Separate pure functions from I/O
1. Avoid duplication - functions that do nearly the same thing
1. Complete the tests - cover all conditions. 

## Self-evaluation

How well does our code hold-out in the rapidly evolving [WHDS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6111409/)?
Can we add future functionality without disturbing existing features? Can we do it with low effort and high reliability?

## The future

- May need new vital signs
- A vendor may provide additional vital readings (e.g., blood pressure)
- Limits may change based on the age of a patient

> Predicting the future requires Astrology!

## Keep it simple and testable

Shorten the Semantic distance

- Procedural to express sequence
- Functional to express relation between input and output
- Object oriented to encapsulate state with actions
- Aspect oriented to capture repeating aspects

=========================================================================
Extend with a feature

Try any one of these extensions on your code. Mention the extension(s) you select in your README.md file.
Extension 1: Early Warning

Care-givers need early warnings to take action, in addition to the alarm that you print after the limit is breached. Introduce a 'warning' level with a tolerance of 1.5% of the upper-limit.

Example: If the body-temperature extremeties are 95 and 102, the warning-tolerance is 1.5% of 102 = 1.53. Warnings need to be displayed in these ranges:

    95 to 95+1.53 Warning: Approaching hypothermia
    102-1.53 to 102 Warning: Approaching hyperthermia

Same for pulse-rate and SPO2.
Extension 2: Support a language in addition to English

Our market has expanded to German-speaking countries! Switch the language of the printed user-messages based on a global variable.

Use Google translate if you aren't familiar with German.

Keep in mind: We could add more languages in future. Minimize the code-change required.
Extension 3: Accept input in different units

Some sensors report the temperature in Celcius. Make provision to express the unit along with the measurement. Avoid repeating the limits in different units.
The starting point

Write a failing test. The asserts will specify the data-models (inputs and outputs). Imagine a care-giver and ensure that the asserts reflect their need.

Experience the places where test / code gets more complex. Think of refactoring opportunities.
Recommended Approach

Treat the problem as a series of data-transformations. A chain of transformations is suggested below.

    Translate to common units

    Map the breach to the ranges. Keep the code common across parameters and vary the data.

    Example: Design a data-structure with a series of numbers representing the boundary of each condition. In the example above:
        upto 95: HYPO_THERMIA
        95 to 96.53: NEAR_HYPO
        96.54 to 100.47: NORMAL
        100.48 to 102: NEAR_HYPER
        102 and above: HYPER_THERMIA

    Translate the condition to a message in the appropriate language

    Output the resulting message

    Infer overall vitals. Make logical assumptions in case of warning and error combinations.

Each transformation is one function (or more). Do not mix different transformations in the same function. Have one function to chain ('compose') these transformation-functions.

IMPORTANT!

Keep it Simple Remove unwanted tests follow good clean code practices Dont create any extra files for explanations, code should be self explanatory Use Delegate logger to Mock Console.WriteLine Use Linq features to reduce code complexity Use lizard to test if CCN < 3 Split the project into well named files Use SRP, DRY and YAGNI keep line count < 50
